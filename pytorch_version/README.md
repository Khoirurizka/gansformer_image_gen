### Pytorch implementation
Our repository now supports both **Tensorflow** (at [the main directory](../)) and **Pytorch** (at this directory). 
The two implementations follow a close code and files structure, and share the same interface. 
To switch from the TF to Pytorch, simply enter into `pytorch_version`, and install the [requirements](requirements.txt).

Please feel free to open an issue or [contact](dorarad@cs.stanford.edu) for any questions or suggestions about the new implementation!
